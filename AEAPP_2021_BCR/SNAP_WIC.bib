abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge of applied work using bunching approaches, a development that is closely linked to the increased availability of administrative data. These approaches exploit the incentives for bunching created by discontinuities in the slope of choice sets (kinks) or in the level of choice sets (notches) to study the behavior of individuals and firms. While the bunching approach was originally developed in the context of taxation, it is beginning to find applications in many other areas such as social security, social insurance, welfare programs, education, regulation, private sector prices, and reference-dependent preferences. This review provides a guide to bunching estimation, discusses its strengths and weaknesses, surveys a range of applications across fields, and considers reasons for the ubiquity of kinks and notches.},

We use administrative data to motivate three approaches to causal inference. The marginal propensity to consume SNAP-eligible food (MPCF) out of SNAP benefits is 0.5 to 0.6. The MPCF out of cash is much smaller. These patterns obtain even for households for whom SNAP benefits are economically equivalent to cash because their benefits are below their food spending. Using a semiparametric framework, we reject the hypothesis that households respect the fungibility of money. A model with mental accounting can match the facts.},

We find that spatial differences in access, though significant, are small relative to spatial differences in the nutritional content of sales. Socioeconomic disparities in nutritional consumption exist even among households with equivalent access, and the healthfulness of household consumption responds minimally to improvements in local retail environments. Our results indicate that access-improving poli-cies alone will eliminate less than one third of existing socioeconomic disparities in nutritional consumption.},

abstract = {This study examines the extent to which geographic variation in Food Stamp Program (FSP) participation is explained by place-based factors, with special attention to the case of the three poorest regions of the United States: Central Appalachia, the Texas Borderland, and the Lower Mississippi Delta. We use descriptive statistics and regression models to assess the prevalence and correlates of county-level FSP participation circa 2005. Our findings show that the economic distress that has long characterized Appalachia, the Borderland, and the Delta clearly translates into greater reliance on the FSP relative to other areas of the country. State-level effects and local-level variations in poverty, labor market conditions, population structure, human capital, and residential context explain much of this reality. Yet, even after taking all of these factors into account, these regional geographies remain home to particularly high FSP participation. Our findings underscore the importance of considering these regions as key cases of study in the stratification of American society and hold a variety of implications for public policy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

For the USDA ERS food deserts measure accuracy statistics for secondary data sources were 94{\%} concordance, 50-65{\%} sensitivity, and 60-64{\%} positive predictive value (PPV). Based on the CDC non-healthier food retail tracts both secondary data demonstrated 88-91{\%} concordance, 80-86{\%} sensitivity and 78-82{\%} PPV.

abstract = {Low access to food retailers selling healthy and affordable foods may lead to reliance on
food retail venues that carry a limited range of foods. Reliance on smaller retail stores
and restaurants may result in a poor diet and diet-related health problems. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture's National Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey
contains abundant data for examining how access to food retailers influences where
households get their food, including stores and restaurants, and how much they spend at
each place. This research looks at households that do not use their own vehicle to travel
to a store and live more than 0.5 mile from the nearest SNAP-authorized supermarket
or superstore, likely barriers to accessing food. Using a national sample and a lowincome
subsample that includes participants of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP), the authors find evidence that access-burdened households have some
distinct shopping patterns. They are less likely to visit a large store (supermarket, supercenter,
or warehouse store) than households with a vehicle or close access (77 percent
compared with 87 percent). While those with burdened access who do visit these venues
do so less frequently, both groups average over two shopping events at these stores (2.4
events for access-burdened households compared with 2.8 for those with sufficient
access). The differences in shopping frequency do not translate to less spending at these
large stores as both access-burdened and sufficient-access households spend about 58
percent of their food budget there. Access-burdened households spend a greater share
of their budget at food-at-home sources (73 percent) and a smaller percentage of their
food at restaurants of all types (27 percent) than households with better access (63
and 37 percent, respectively). Overall spending patterns are similar for both SNAP-participating
and low-income nonparticipating households that are access-burdened
compared with those who have sufficient access.},

@article{Shannon2014,
abstract = {Current GIS based research on food access has focused primarily on the proximity of food sources to places of residence in low-income communities, with relatively little attention given to actual practices of food procurement. This project addresses this issue by using dasymetric mapping techniques to develop fine scale estimates of benefit usage for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, drawing from existing zip code level data on benefit distribution and redemptions. Based on this data, this research shows that while supermarkets receive almost all SNAP benefits in suburban areas, these stores have a smaller share of all SNAP redemptions in low-income core neighborhoods. In these latter areas, both convenience stores and mid-sized grocers (e.g., discount grocers, food cooperatives, ethnic markets) play a much larger role in residents' food shopping, even when supermarkets are also present. In addition, these core neighborhoods have a net "outflow" of SNAP dollars, meaning that residents of these areas receive more in benefits than is spent at neighborhood food retailers. This finding confirms existing research showing that low-income residents often travel outside their neighborhoods to get food, regardless of the presence or absence of supermarkets. Rather than simply increasing the number of large food outlets in low-access areas, this research suggests that efforts to improve food access and community health must take into account the geographically complex ways residents interact with the food system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Variation in where consumers have lived in the past allows us to isolate the causal effect of past experiences on current purchases, holding constant contemporaneous supply-side factors such as availability, prices, and advertising. Heterogeneity in brand preferences explains 40 percent of geographic variation in market shares. These preferences develop endogenously as a function of consumers' life histories and are highly persistent once formed, with experiences 50 years in the past still exerting a significant effect on current consumption. Counterfactuals suggest that brand preferences create large entry barriers and durable advantages for incumbent firms, and can explain persistence of early-mover advantage over long periods. Variation across product categories shows that the persistence of brand preferences is related in an intuitive way to both advertising levels and the social visibility of consumption.},

abstract = {Congress is again debating work requirements in the context of programs to aid poor and lowincome individuals and families. The last major debate in the 1990s both significantly expanded financial supports for working poor families with children and led to the enactment of the 1996 welfare reform law. That law created the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant, which time-limited federally funded aid and required work for families receiving cash assistance. Work requirements, time limits, and work incentives are intended to offset work disincentives in social assistance programs, promote a culture of work over dependency, and prioritize governmental resources. Another rationale for such policies is that without income from work, a person and his or her family members are almost certain to be poor. For many of these same reasons, some policymakers recently have expressed interest in extending mandatory work requirements and related policies—similar to those included in TANF—to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and housing assistance (public housing and the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Recent research on access to food among low-income populations in industrialised countries has begun to focus on neighbourhood food availability as a key determinant of dietary behaviour. This study examined the relationship between various measures of food store access and household fruit and vegetable use among participants in the Food Stamp Program, America's largest domestic food assistance programme. DESIGN: A secondary data analysis was conducted using the 1996-97 National Food Stamp Program Survey. The survey employed a 1-week food inventory method, including two at-home interviews, to determine household food use. Separate linear regression models were developed to analyse fruit and vegetable use. Independent variables included distance to store, travel time to store, ownership of a car and difficulty of supermarket access. All models controlled for a full set of socio-economic variables. SUBJECTS: A nationally representative sample of participants (n=963) in the Food Stamp Program. RESULTS: After controlling for confounding variables, easy access to supermarket shopping was associated with increased household use of fruits (84 grams per adult equivalent per day; 95{\%} confidence interval 5, 162). Distance from home to food store was inversely associated with fruit use by households. Similar patterns were seen with vegetable use, though associations were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Environmental factors are importantly related to dietary choice in a nationally representative sample of low-income households, reinforcing the importance of including such factors in interventions that seek to effect dietary improvements.},

abstract = {Background There are {\textgreater}25,000 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)−authorized dollar stores throughout the United States; many are located in lower-income neighborhoods and provide an accessible food and beverage source for area residents. Objective The purpose of this research was to determine the percent of food deserts within 16 counties in North Carolina that include a SNAP dollar store; examine the types of foods and beverages at SNAP dollar stores in these counties; test whether the foods and beverages offered vary by SNAP dollar store chain; and test whether the foods and beverages available differ by rural and urban location. Design This cross-sectional study used a combination of publicly available data and primary data to investigate the research questions. Secondary data sources were obtained from the US Department of Agriculture's SNAP retailer locator, the US Census, and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Access Research Atlas. Availability of foods and beverages was assessed among a sample of 90 SNAP dollar stores in 16 counties in southern and western sections of North Carolina. Data were collected in June 2014. Results About half (52{\%}) of the food deserts in the research area included a SNAP dollar store. Most of the sampled stores sold healthier food staples, such as frozen meats, brown rice, 100{\%} whole-wheat bread, and dried beans. None of the stores sold fresh fruits or vegetables. Some of the foods and beverages offered (eg, frozen fruit, frozen unseasoned vegetables, nonfat or low-fat milk, frozen ground beef) varied by SNAP dollar store chain. The foods and beverages offered did not differ by rural or urban county location. Conclusions SNAP dollar stores offer a number of healthy food staples; however, they do not sell fresh fruits or vegetables. Further food environment research should include dollar stores.},

Low-income resi- dents of these neighborhoods and those who lack transportation rely more on smaller neighborhood stores that may not carry healthy foods or may offer them only at higher prices. A lack of healthy options could lead to poor diets and to diet-related conditions such as obesity or diabetes. If low-income households in food des- erts can only purchase food at higher prices, they may be more prone to food insecurity—not having enough food for active, healthy living.},

Using county-level, administrative data on redemption of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by store type from May 2007 to May 2010, this paper investigates aggregate responses of SNAP participants to economic and policy changes. Results show that SNAP benefit increases, in general, are associated with a greater percentage of redemptions at superstores. However, other circumstances associated with the large increase in benefits enacted in April 2009 as a part of the stimulus bill reverse the positive effect. Estimates are stable across a number of specifications that also control for gas prices, store-type density, local unemployment and state policies. Results suggest that economic incentives deserve further consideration as an alternative to store development in food desert communities.},

abstract = {The food stamp program (SNAP) is one of the most important elements of the social safety net and is the second largest anti-poverty program for children in the U.S. (only the EITC raises more children above poverty). The program varies little across states and over time, which creates challenges for quasi-experimental evaluation. Notably, SNAP benefit levels are fixed across 48 states; but local food prices vary widely, leading to substantial variation in the real value of SNAP benefits. In this study, we leverage time variation in the real value of the SNAP benefit across markets to examine the effects of SNAP on child health. We link panel data on regional food prices and the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan, as measured by the USDA's Quarterly Food at Home Price Database, to restricted-access geo-located National Health Interview Survey data on samples of SNAP-recipient and SNAP-eligible children. We estimate the relationship between the real value of SNAP benefits (i.e., the ratio of the SNAP maximum benefit to the TFP price faced by a household) and children's health and health care utilization, in a fixed effects framework that controls for a number of individual-level and region characteristics, including non-food prices. Our findings indicate that children in market regions with a lower real value of SNAP benefits utilize significantly less health care, and may utilize emergency room care at increased rates. Lower real SNAP benefits also lead to an increase in school absences but we find no effect on reported health status. Executive},

Often such " mover regressions " are motivated by additively-separable and constant-effect causal model; it is not clear, however, how to interpret regression estimates when these models are misspecified. I show that under standard parallel trends and stationarity as-sumptions, mover regressions with two treatments and two time periods identify a convex average of heterogeneous treatment effects, but that stronger restrictions on outcome variability are needed for causal interpretation when treatment is multi-valued. I propose instead a class of non-parametric estimators identifying a set of mover average treatment effects (MATEs) under weaker conditional parallel trend and effect homogeneity assumptions. I characterize the efficient estimator in this class, and derive specification tests from the model's overidentifying restrictions. * I thank Alberto Abadie, Isaiah Andrews, Josh Angrist, Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham, and Chris Walters for valuable feedback.

Purchase quality was measured using a healthy purchasing index (HPI). Findings indicate that WIC foods explain the improvement in quality of food purchases, not self-selection of more nutrition-conscious households into the program. Households participating in WIC have a higher HPI in comparison to eligible non-participating households. Importantly, this difference is driven entirely by WIC participating households who redeemed WIC foods during the interview week. There was no significant difference between WIC-participants who did not redeem WIC foods and eligible non-participants. The paper also examines whether geographic barriers limit WIC participation. Locations of WIC clinics were added to the already detailed FoodAPS information on food store locations. There is no evidence in this sample that access to clinics is adversely affecting participation nor is there evidence that HPI depends on supermarket access. Finally, a supervised machine learning process supports our main conclusion that WIC-provided foods are the driver of increased HPI, not self-selection of healthier households into the program. 2},

This is one among a portfolio of strategies that can support individuals and families in improving diet and may lead to preventing or reducing obesity. 1,2 To implement this strategy, some states have enacted legislation to attract full-service grocery stores and supermarkets to underserved communities and to improve the quality of the foods that are sold at small corner stores (collectively referred to as " healthier food retail legislation " in this document). In addition to the health benefits of such initiatives, communities may realize economic benefits as well, including job creation and community-wide revitalization. 3 Food retail outlets, such as grocery stores and supermarkets, can serve as " anchors " to other types of commercial development and may increase retail activity, employment rates, and property values in surrounding neighborhoods. 4 This document provides public health practitioners, their partners, and policy makers with useful information about the rationale for and characteristics of healthier food retail legislation enacted in the last decade.

abstract = {The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act waived Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) work requirements nationally in 2010 and broadened the eligibility for receiving waivers in subsequent years for Able-Bodied Adults without Dependents (ABAWD). From 2011 to 2016, many states voluntarily imposed work requirements, while other areas became ineligible for waivers because of improved economic conditions. Did the work requirements increase employment as intended, or did the policy merely remove food assistance for ABAWD who-despite an improving economy-still could not find employment? Using data from the American Community Survey from 2010 to 2016, I analyze the influence of work requirements on employment and SNAP participation for ABAWD. I find that work requirements significantly decreased SNAP participation and marginally increased employment for ABAWD using Difference-inDifference in Differences estimation. This study contributes to the current policy debates on the effectiveness of expanding or instituting work requirements for welfare programs.

For example, states can allow children to enroll in Medicaid/CHIP for 12 months regardless of family income changes.

However, I find little evidence of strategic behavior from the 2001 and 2004 Survey of Income and Program Participation. Given the lack of dynamic responses, I propose a framework to compute the optimal recertification period and find 12 months to be its lower bound. },

I calculate county false-negative (FN) and false-positive (FP) rates for each year of observation and find that, within a given state and year, there is substantial heterogeneity in FN rates across counties. In addition, I find evidence that FN rates (but not FP rates) persist over time within counties. This persistence in FN rates is strongest among more populous counties, suggesting that when noise from sampling variation is not an issue, some counties have consistently high FN rates while others have consistently low FN rates. This finding is important for understanding how misreporting might bias estimates of sub-state SNAP participation rates, changes in those participation rates, and effects of program participation.},

Using Survey of Income and Program Participation data on U.S. households, we test the importance of both stable and transitory income components in determining food insufficiency. In a logistic regression model, we find that both the level of income and negative income shocks affect the predicted probability of food insufficiency, while positive income shocks do not. Although we do not have a definitive measure of a household's liquidity constraint status, our work suggests that negative shocks may matter more for households that face liquidity constraints. Understanding the role of income shocks in determining food insufficiency is especially important in light of recent policy changes. It is likely that welfare reform in the U.S. increased the volatility of income in the low-income population. Our findings here suggest that this increase in volatility may not be without consequence.},

@article{Owyang2013,
abstract = {A central issue in economics concerns how output (equivalent to income) is distributed across economic agents (e.g., workers, entrepreneurs). A first step in addressing this issue is understanding how output (or income) is distributed in the United States and understanding how the distribution has changed over time. Measuring income inequality, however, is not a trivial endeavor. Multiple sources of income—salary, capital gains income, employerprovided health insurance and other nonsalaried compensation, etc.—make simply measuring income itself problematic. Nonetheless, using a number of different definitions of income and employing various metrics, researchers have attempted to quantify income inequality in the U.S. Economists have identified two broad periods in income inequality over the postWorld War II period—first in the 1970s and then, more recently, prior to the Great Recession. In the sections that follow, we describe how income inequality is measured and then how it changed over these two periods. Income Inequality and How It's Measured Assessing income inequality boils down in effect to measuring the income gaps between high and low earners. Income inequality implies that the lowerincome population receives disproportionately less income than the higherincome population: The larger the disparity, the greater the degree of income inequality. To measure inequality, economists often sort the population by income percentiles and measure the difference across these percentiles. For example, the top 10 percent of earners would be the 90th percentile. A related way of dividing the population is quintiles, which split the distribution into five even buckets (the bottom quintile is the 20th percentile); quintiles are commonly used percentiles for studying inequality except at the top of the income distribution, where the income difference between 98th and 99th percentiles is large. To summarize inequality across the entire distribution, economists use the Gini coefficient. The Gini coefficient measures income concentration at each percentile of the population and ranges from 0 (perfectly equal) to 1 (perfectly unequal). In order to study income inequality, one needs income at an individual level. While gross domestic product is the usual aggregate indicator for income, there are many definitions of income and many data sources available at the individual level. Economists often use the Internal Revenue Service's Statistics of Income program (SOI) or the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS). Studies using different data sources reach various conclusions on income inequality, depending on the definition used for income. For example, economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez compiled a dataset using SOI data back to 1913. They focused on the share of income earned by the top percentiles to avoid poor data quality in the lower percentiles.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for evaluating the welfare impact of various interventions designed to increase take-up of social safety net programs in the presence of potential behavioral biases. We calibrate the key parameters using a randomized field experiment in which 30,000 elderly individuals not enrolled in – but likely eligible for – the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are either provided with information that they are likely eligible, provided with this information and also offered assistance in applying, or are in a “status quo” control group. Only 6 percent of the control group enrolls in SNAP over the next 9 months, compared to 11 percent of the Information Only group and 18 percent of the Information Plus Assistance group. The individuals who apply or enroll in response to either intervention receive lower benefits and are less sick than the average enrollee in the control group. The results are consistent with the existence of optimization frictions that are greater for needier individuals, suggesting that the poor targeting properties of the interventions reduce their welfare gains.},

abstract = {The literature assessing the efficacy of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program, has long puzzled over positive associations between SNAP receipt and various undesirable health outcomes such as food insecurity. Assessing the causal impacts of SNAP, however, is hampered by two key identification problems: endogenous selection into participation and extensive systematic underreporting of participation status. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we extend partial identification bounding methods to account for these two identification problems in a single unifying framework. Specifically, we derive informative bounds on the average treatment effect (ATE) of SNAP on child food insecurity, poor general health, obesity, and anemia across a range of different assumptions used to address the selection and classification error problems. In particular, to address the selection problem, we apply relatively weak nonparametric assumptions on the latent outcomes, selected treatments, and observed covariates. To address the classification error problem, we formalize a new approach that uses auxiliary administrative data on the size of the SNAP caseload to restrict the magnitudes and patterns of SNAP reporting errors. Layering successively stronger assumptions, an objective of our analysis is to make transparent how the strength of the conclusions varies with the strength of the identifying assumptions. Under the weakest restrictions, there is substantial ambiguity; we cannot rule out the possibility that SNAP increases or decreases poor health. Under stronger but plausible assumptions used to address the selection and classification error problems, we find that commonly cited relationships between SNAP and poor health outcomes provide a misleading picture about the true impacts of the program. Our tightest bounds identify favorable impacts of SNAP on child health.},

abstract = {Gauging the efficacy of safety net programs requires a good understanding of how the interactions between them affect the total benefits and costs of any given policy change. This paper investigates the interactions between health and nutritional assistance programs such as Medicaid, SNAP, WIC, and school lunch programs. Since 1999, states have been given much more flexibility to operate SNAP, and many states have expanded eligibility to include households with income and resources above the existing federal limits for SNAP. Exploiting this variation in SNAP eligibility across states and over time, I find strong evidence of program interactions: when a state moves from the federal rule to the most extensive SNAP eligibility rule, enrollment in free school lunch increases by 4 percentage points. I estimate that the federal government spends an additional 37 cents on the school lunch program for each dollar spent on SNAP due to the expansion. However, expanded eligibility for SNAP leads to a significant decrease in private insurance coverage for both adults and children, which is not fully explained by an increase in Medicaid enrollment. Exploring potential channels through which SNAP expansions affect participation in other safety net programs, I find evidence that automatic eligibility, and a reduction in employment, play a role in program interactions.},

This misreporting leads to biased estimates of the economic circumstances of disadvantaged populations, program takeup, and the distributional effects of government programs, and other program effects. We use administrative data on Food Stamp Program (FSP) participation matched to American Community Survey (ACS) and Current Population Survey (CPS) household data. We show that nearly thirty-five percent of true recipient households do not report receipt in the ACS and fifty percent do not report receipt in the CPS. Misreporting, both false negatives and false positives, varies with individual characteristics, leading to complicated biases in FSP analyses. We then directly examine the determinants of program receipt using our combined administrative and survey data. The combined data allow us to examine accurate participation using individual characteristics missing in administrative data. Our results differ from conventional estimates using only survey data, as such estimates understate participation by single parents, non-whites, low income households, and other groups. To evaluate the use of Census Bureau imputed ACS and CPS data, we also examine whether our estimates using survey data alone are closer to those using the accurate combined data when imputed survey observations are excluded. Interestingly, excluding the imputed observations leads to worse ACS estimates, but has less effect on the CPS estimates.},

abstract = {Background "Churning" in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is defined as when a household exits SNAP and then re-enters the program within 4 months. Churning is a policy concern due to the financial and administrative burden incurred by both SNAP households and State agencies that administer SNAP. Forgone benefits among households who were eligible while not participating in the program, participant time and expense involved in reapplying for the program, and the added Federal and State administrative costs associated with case closings and reopenings are among the larger policy concerns. This study explores the circumstances of churning in SNAP by determining the rates and patterns of churn, examining the causes of caseload churn, and calculating costs of churn to both participants and administering agencies in six States. Methods The study used both quantitative and qualitative data from six States-Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Texas, and Virginia. (While these States were selected to reflect the varying geographic, technological, and policy environments in which SNAP operates, the combined findings may not be representative at the national level.) Data collected for the study include State administrative data for fiscal year (FY) 2011 and qualitative data from focus groups and interviews of several stakeholder groups including State program staff and administrators, community-based organizations (CBOs), and SNAP participants.},

Our study aims to complement the spatial dimension of access measures by bringing time in as a new constraint on food access. To this end, we developed three measures of spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal access and correlated these measures with socioeconomic status (SES) in a case in Columbus, Ohio. Findings from our analysis of food access disparity suggest that low-SES neighborhoods in Columbus are not at a disadvantage of spatial access, but their limited temporal access is a more pressing concern. Implications drawn from the study would assist community advocates, local governments, and other stakeholders in deriving a better understanding of the local foodscape that are not only mediated by space but also time.

abstract = {We examine the consequences of underreporting of transfer programs in household survey data for several prototypical analyses of low-income populations. We focus on the Current Population Survey (CPS), the source of official poverty and inequality statistics, but provide evidence that our qualitative conclusions are likely to apply to other surveys. We link administrative data for food stamps, TANF, General Assistance, and subsidized housing from New York State to the CPS at the individual level. Program receipt in the CPS is missed for over one-third of housing assistance recipients, 40 percent of food stamp recipients, and 60 percent of TANF and General Assistance recipients. Dollars of benefits are also undercounted for reporting recipients, particularly for TANF, General Assistance and housing assistance. We find that the survey data sharply understate the income of poor households, as conjectured in past work by one of the authors. Underreporting in the survey data also greatly understates the effects of anti-poverty programs and changes our understanding of program targeting, often making it seem that welfare programs are less targeted to both the very poorest and middle income households than they are. Using the combined data rather than survey data alone, the poverty reducing effect of all programs together is nearly doubled while the effect of housing assistance is tripled. We also re-examine the coverage of the safety net, specifically the share of people without work or program receipt. Using the administrative measures of program receipt rather than the survey ones often reduces the share of single mothers falling through the safety net by one-half or more.},

Our method uses information on the amount of bunching in the earnings distribution at convex budget set kinks before and after policy changes in the earnings incentives around the kinks: the larger is the adjustment cost, the smaller is the absolute change in bunching from before to after the policy change. We apply this method in the context of the convex kink created by the Social Security Annual Earnings Test (AET). Using a one percent sample of earnings histories from Social Security Administration micro-data, we show that individuals continue to bunch at the kink formerly created by the AET even when they are no longer subject to the AET, indicating that they must face adjustment frictions. We estimate in a baseline case that the earnings elasticity with respect to the implicit net-of-tax share is 0.35, and the xed cost of adjustment is around {\$}280. Our results demonstrate that the short-run impact of changes in the e¤ective marginal tax rate can be substantially attenuated, which can inform projections of the timing of earnings responses to tax and transfer policies.},

We use the cross-county introduction of the program in the 1960s and 1970s to estimate the impact of the program on the extensive and intensive margins of labor supply, earnings, and family cash income. Consistent with theory, we find reductions in employment and hours worked when food stamps are introduced.

abstract = {Background: Residents in poor neighborhoods have higher body mass index (BMI) and eat less healthfully. One possible reason might be the quality of available foods in their area. Location of grocery stores where individuals shop and its association with BMI were examined. Methods: The 2000 U.S. Census data were linked with the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study (L.A.FANS) database, which consists of 2620 adults sampled from 65 neighborhoods in Los Angeles County between 2000 and 2002. In 2005, multilevel linear regressions were used to estimate the associations between BMI and socioeconomic characteristics of grocery store locations after adjustment for individual-level factors and socioeconomic characteristics of residential neighborhoods. Results: Individuals have higher BMI if they reside in disadvantaged areas and in areas where the average person frequents grocery stores located in more disadvantaged neighborhoods. Those who own cars and travel farther to their grocery stores also have higher BMI. When controlling for grocery store census tract socioeconomic status (SES), the association between residential census tract SES and BMI becomes stronger. Conclusions: Where people shop for groceries and distance traveled to grocery stores are independently associated with BMI. Exposure to grocery store mediates and suppresses the association of residential neighborhoods with BMI and could explain why previous studies may not have found robust associations between residential neighborhood predictors and BMI. ?? 2006 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

After having identified a statistically and economically significant discontinuity in native population growth at candidate tipping points in the three metropolitan areas of Sweden between 1990 and 2000, we show that these thresholds also are associated with a discontinuous jump in ethnic residential segregation. We exploit these thresholds to estimate the intent-to-treat effect of tipping. We find modest adverse education effects among both immigrants and natives.

We present evidence supporting three predictions of this model by analyzing bunching at kinks using Danish tax records. First, larger kinks generate larger taxable income elasticities. Second, kinks that apply to a larger group of workers generate larger elasticities. Third, the distribution of job offers is tailored to match workers' aggregate tax preferences in equilibrium.

In this paper we examine the relationship between poverty, the social safety net, and business cycles historically and test whether there has been a significant change in this relationship during the Great Recession. We do so using an alternative measure of poverty that incorporates taxes and in-kind transfers. We explore the mediating role played by four core safety net programs—Food Stamps, cash welfare (AFDC/TANF), the Earned Income Tax Credit, and Unemployment Insurance—in buffering families from negative economic shocks. This analysis yields several important findings. Our most robust and important finding is the safety net is doing less to provide protection for the most disadvantaged. In the post-welfare reform world, TANF did not respond in the Great Recession and extreme poverty is more cyclical than in prior recessions. On the other hand, Food Stamps and UI are providing more protection-or at least providing no less protection-in the Great Recession, although these results are less robust across our different models. These programs are more likely to affect households somewhat higher up the income distribution; we find some evidence of a reduction in cyclicality at 100{\%} poverty and little evidence about this at higher income-to-poverty levels.

abstract = {A majority of literature about food deserts is focused on geographic access to food retailers by a buffered distance differentiating high and low access. An overlooked facet in this representation is that food acquisition is not only geographically dictated, but it is also temporally constrained. Food retailers invariably have limited opening hours that create a temporal restriction for shoppers. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) construct was proposed to delineate the limited food access to a retailer location across space and over its time of operation. Food retailer data in Columbus, OH, USA were collected for examining the variation of food access on both spatial and temporal scales. This study also employed the technique of interactive 3D modeling in a geographic information system (GIS) to visualize the food environment to delimit where and when food is accessible on a daily basis. The interactive 3D geovisualization (visualization of geographic information) of space-time access contributed to improving the representation of food environment and exploring the inequity of food access across space and over time. The development of this geovisualization context for food science studies could assist public health professionals and government stakeholders in understanding the effect of temporal access and improving food access for regions with limited operation hours in policy formulation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Nugroho2013a,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Robert2004,
abstract = {The labor supply and other work incentive effects of welfare programs have long been a central concern in economic research. Work has also been an increasing focus of policy reforms in the USA, culminating with a number of major policy changes in the 1990s whose intent was to increase employment and earnings levels of welfare recipients and other disadvantaged individuals. This chapter reviews the economic research on this topic, covering both the theoretical models that have been developed as well as the empirical findings from econometric studies of the effects of existing welfare programs on labor supply.},

@article{Bania2009,
abstract = {We investigate changes in monthly income volatility in non-elderly households in the U.S. since the early 1990s. Using the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we find that monthly income volatility is highest for lower income households, and that it increased substantially for these households between 1992 and 2003. The increase appears to have its roots in the shift of household income away from relatively stable public assistance (AFDC/TANF) benefits and towards earnings. We subject these findings to sensitivity analyses and find similar results. We also find increases in volatility among households with incomes above the poverty line, but these findings are less robust in the face of some sensitivity analyses.},

@article{Bollinger2019,
abstract = {Earnings nonresponse in household surveys is widespread, yet there is limited evidence on whether and how nonresponse bias affects measured earnings. This paper examines the patterns and consequences of nonresponse on earnings gaps and inequality using Census internal Current Population Survey individual records linked to Social Security administrative data on earnings for calendar years 2005-2010. We find that the common assumption that earnings are missing at random is rejected, and that nonresponse across the earnings distribution is U-shaped—left-tail " strugglers " and right-tail " stars " are least likely to report earnings. Approximately one-third to one-half the difference in inequality measures between the CPS and administrative data is accounted for by nonresponse in the CPS. Earnings differentials by race, gender, and education in lower and upper quantiles are biased from nonresponse as much as 20 percent. We recommend users of public CPS data adopt flexible copula-based models to correct for nonrandom nonresponse for distributional research.},
